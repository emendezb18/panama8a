            Even though the alliance with Colombia was voluntary, not all Panamanians were in agreement. Panamanians didnâ€™t want to be more of La Gran Colombia. In 1903 a door opened for them. It all started with the construction of the Panama Canal. Colombia made agreements with a French company and Ferdinand Lesseps(the one that made the Suez Canal) to build the Panama Canal in 1882. Unfortunately for Lesseps, the Panama Canal was harder to build than the Suez. Problems arrived in the construction and even death took place. The French company went bankrupt and the U.S bought the construction. La Gran Colombia broke down and Panama became part of Colombia. The U.S tried to make agreements with Colombia for the canal, but Colombia rejected the treaties. Taking advantage of the situation, Panama, rebelled against Colombia and declared its independence in 1904 with the help of the U.S.
