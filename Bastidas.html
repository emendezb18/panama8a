    <h1 class="title"><center>Bastidas Arrives to the Itsmo and Colony is Established</center></h1>
        <p>
            On an unexpected expedition In 1501 Rodrigo Galvan de Bastidas was the first European to discover the Isthmus of Panama, but he did not actually establish any colonies at this time. It was not until the following year that Christopher Colombus reached the isthmus through the Atlantic coast and then named what is now the province of Colon in Panama, “Portobelo”.  The Spanish then left. <br>


            Then in 1510 the Spanish came back to Panama and were forced to abandon the region in the first months because local panamanian indegenous resistance was sufficient to repel the Spanish conquest. It was not until later that they were finally able to establish Santa maría la antigua del darién, which was the first city founded by Europeans in Panama which would later become Panama City. <br>
            
            The Spanish used this city as their main base to build ships and a starting point for the exploration and conquest of peru. 
            Nowadays, this city, “Panama Viejo” is declared as a historical monument and available as an archeological site to the public and tourists which consists of various ruins. The site counts with the Catedral de nuestra señora de la asunción, convento de la concepción, museo de la plaza mayor, convento de la compañía de jesus, and several other ruined buildings. This place is a major part in appreciating what Panama is today, where it all began and all of the background of the country.
