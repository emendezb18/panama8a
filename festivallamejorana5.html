        The name comes from the traditional panamanian instrument the mejorana, a small guitar with only 5 strings, The proposal to celebrate this Panamanian culture tradition was first brought up in 1949 by Dr. Manuel Fernando Zárate at a gathering with some guararenos.
        Zárate chose to merge the cultural celebration with El dia de la Virgen de las Mercedes on September 24th when his daughter unexpectedly regained her health. The festival would start on a sunday and end on the next sunday with specific numerous celebrations throughout the week.

        The celebration is open to any tourists that would like to be involved in this joyful ceremony. It is the opportunity for artisans to show their work, which include handcrafts such as saddlery, skirts, shakes and the musical instrument that gives the name of the festival, the mejorana, known for being the dance and song of Panamanians. It also offers foreigners who visit the country an opportunity to appreciate the cultural traditions of Panama.
