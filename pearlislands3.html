    <h3>Magical Break in Gorgeous Islands </h3>
<p>
    The Pearl Islands or Islas Las Perlas is an archipelago located in the Gulf of Panama. The archipelago has a collection of approximately 200 islands which a lot of them are islets (small islands that are uninhabited). The name is because a long time ago there were found a lot of pearls in oysters in the surroundings of the waters. In the present, they are also called like that due to their white sands and their “jewel-like perfection”. Even though the archipelago counts numerous islands and islets, tourism is not big. Panama is very strict about the preservation of a lot of natural things. That’s why the islands have so much magic and preservation, but some islands, mainly the bigger ones, are available to tourists.

    The Pearl Islands are part of the biodiversity of Panama, which makes them important for the country. Tourists can only go to the islands by air or sea. Contadora Island (the most important inhabited island) counts with an airport for flights. Ferry services go only twice per day and it takes 2 hours from the port to Contadora Island. On the islands, you can have several activities like scuba diving, whale watching, boat tours, bird watching, snorkeling, sport fishing, and beach hopping. When tourists get to Contadora Island they opt to take long walks through the island. It is rumored that the name Contadora was because the island was the “counting house” of the pearls of the archipelago. Now, the island counts with various resorts and tourist activity.
