    <h3>A Cultural Trip</h3>
        <p>
            The Emberá Village is the home of one of the most important indigenous tribes in Panama, the Emberá. The village is located not too far from Panama City. At the water’s edge of the Chagres river, you can find the village of this magical tribe. The region is surrounded by dense rainforests and biodiversity. The Chagres River is one of the most important water supplies for the Panama Canal and also acts as a water supply for Panama City.

            Here you will learn from the Emberá tribe. They will be happy to show you their beliefs and affection towards the water and tell you stories like how the water was created, how rivers were created, who lives in the deepnesses of freshwaters, and hear the terror stories about Antumía. You can also do some traditional things there like have a temporary natural tattoo made of Jagua fruit or maybe buy some special crafts made by Emberá women. You can also experience their culture by watching their traditional dance.
