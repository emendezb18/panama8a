            The gulf counts with a large number of islands like the isla las perlas, an archipelago with around 200 islands, mystical preservation, wildlife, and colonial and pre columbian history. The Cocle and Cueva indigenous tribes, who lived in the Islands in the 15th and 16th centuries, are the first known inhabitants of the Gulf. When Vasco Nuez de Balboa a Spanish conquistador, discovered the islands in 1513, the majority of these native inhabitants were either murdered or sold into slavery. They were forced to collect the pearls that later gave name to the Pearl Island Archipelago. Another Conquistador learned about the hidden riches in the Islands in 1516, and he not only turned the last free natives into slaves but also brought in slaves from Africa to help find the pearls that were so beautiful. The descendants of the African slaves make up the majority of the tiny population on the islands today. 
      

            Among the plenty of species inhabiting this gulf are about 20 species of birds, mammals and reptiles like giant sea turtles, racoons, tamandua, porcupines, anteaters and reptiles including iguanas, snakes, lizards.

            In the modern day tourism is one of the biggest sources of income in Panama and the gulf makes a large contribution. The biggest island, isla del rey is filled with luxurious resorts and rentable beach homes, as well as the isla contadora that contains colonial times spanish ruined buildings which are a great tourist attraction.
