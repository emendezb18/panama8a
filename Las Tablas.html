    <h3>The Rivalry Turned Into Celebration</h3>
        <p>
            This vibrant and lively festival, which is one of Panama's best known cultural events, lasts four days in March before Ash Wednesday each year. This yearly event was first celebrated in the 19th century as a rivalry between the Calle Arriba and Calle Abajo religious groups, who both created songs and dances to battle other groups four days before Catholics begin Lent. The carnival now symbolizes harmony and unity as a result of the hard forgiveness of this big fight. To remember the early stages of this historic event, traditional folk songs and dances were performed throughout the celebration. People go from all over the world to enjoy the vibrant parades that mark this in the majority of the cities and villages in Panama. The festival takes the name from the city where it takes place, Las Tablas.
