        <p>
            On November 10, 1821, the Independence of Villa de Los Santos, Panama, under the command of Colonel Segundo de Villarreal marked the beginning of the Panamanian movement for independence from the Spanish Crown. And due to the war with France Spain was going through and the political chaos, conflicts, and power vacuums that resulted from it consequently weakened their troops, the independence was remarkably pacific. When the war with Spain had finished in Panama, Colombia asked Panama to join them in La Gran Colombia. La Gran Colombia was a viceroyalty that was composed of Panama, Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador.
