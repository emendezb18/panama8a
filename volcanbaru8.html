  <h3>The Interoceanic Peak</h3>
  <p>
    In the north of Panama is the Province of Chiriqui, where Volcán Baru National park is located. Due to the region's volcanic soil, it is known worldwide for producing geisha coffee. The Extremely High elevations are used to cultivate this coffee. The park is a beautiful ecosystem with significant ecological and geological importance that preserves the biological richness that it contains. Situated in this park is Panama's highest peak, The massive Baru Volcano, at 3,474 meters high, is Central America's 12th highest mountain and the only spot in the world where on a clear day you can view the fascinant Atlantic and Pacific Oceans at the same exact time. Because of a combination of rainforest highlands and the wonderful remains of volcanic eruptions that took place millions of years ago, the volcano and the area around it is home to five distinct ecosystems.
