    <h3>The First City in Panama</h3>
        <p>
            Old Panama or Panamá La Vieja is one of the most important places and museums in Panamá. As its name reveals, Old Panama is the remaining part of the old Panama City. Unfortunately, the city was destroyed on January 28, 1671, by the English pirate Henry Morgan. That day thousands of lives were lost and Panama had to be rebuilt a few kilometers away (Now Panama City).

            The ruins of Old Panama take up 57 acres. Tourists like to go and experience the sad but historical places where the real Panama City once existed. Through the monuments, you can find old religious buildings, family houses, shops, hospitals, and much more. Make sure to visit the museum that tells the complete history of the city.
