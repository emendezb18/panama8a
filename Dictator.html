            Panamanians were not happy about the constant US interventions in the country's affairs. The discontent grew and it was on january 9, 1964 that the people finally began a protest against it, when the presence of US military decreased the national guard took advantage and decided to overthrow the government and take complete control over the country, Omar torrijos, a military colonel who participated in the coup, was named supreme leader of the revolution. During his reign he increased social services and official positions for Panamanians of African heritage, but also increased corruption and drug trafficking. Following a constitutional reform and an agricultural reform in 1972, the dictatorship affected Panama's political and socio economic structure in benefit of the poor. Omar put the country into debt as a result of a huge public works program, despite this, he succeeded in pressuring US President Jimmy Carter to give over control of the canal to Panama. The Treaty guaranteed the total removal of US military forces as well as complete Panamanian management of the canal by December 31, 1999. Many panamanians believe that Omar Torrijos' were quite positive despite the dictatorship, there is a numerous amount of contradicting thoughts amongst panamanians about him. Torrijos died in a plane crash in 1981. His soccesor was Manuel Noriega, former chief of military intelligence in Panama for the CIA who also participated in the coup that put torrijos in power. His rule lasted from 1983 to 1990 and it was a day after he was named president that he declared war on the US after he was accused by the country of the muder of Hugo spadafora, a politician in opposition to his reign assassinated by decapitation, drug trafficking, and money laundering. 
            After more than 30 years since this hurtful period in Panama, the residues remain in the hearts of the panamanians that suffered this brutal and bloody era.
