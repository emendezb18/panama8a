            Noriega had a plan to rule Panama. He took out of power the recently elected president, Guillermo Endara, and put in his place a puppet president, Francisco Rodriguez. Unfortunately for Noriega, his plan was failing. The U.S announced that  Noriega had charges in the United States and France for drug trafficking, money laundering, and even murder. Options were shown to Noriega so he wouldn’t have the charges more, but he didn’t accept them. After that, Panama announced that war existed with the United States, and it was known that the PDF(Panamanian Defense Forces) killed an unarmed U.S marine in civilian clothes. U.S president George W. Bush declared Operation Just Cause.  Noriega got authorization from the Panamanian National Assembly to be named the maximum leader. It is estimated that 23 U.S soldiers, 200-300 Panamanian combatants, and 300 Panamanian civilians perish during the traumatic war. Noriega was capture captured in the Vatican Embassy when he surrendered after he had been hiding in the Vatican. U.S troops achieved the surrender of Noriega by putting rock music at high levels in Noriega’s sanctuary. Noriega was convicted to 40 years of federal prison. After extradition and imprisonment in Panama, he died in a Panama City hospital on May 29, 2019. Since then, Panamanian civilians enjoy their freedom when they elect their president.
