    <h3>The Waterway That Changed Panama</h3>
    <p>
    The Panama Canal is a human-made waterway that connects the Atlantic and Pacific ocean through the isthmus of Panama. The canal is 40 miles long from the start to the end of the waterway. The estimated time it takes for a ship to pass from side to side is of 10 hours. Ships from any country can pass without restriction, even Russia with all the restrictions that the country has passed in the world due to the invasion of Ukraine. The Panama Canal is considered one of the seven wonders of the modern world.

    The canal is an essential part of Panama's economy taking 10% of Panama’s GDP. This canal represents a lot of Panama’s economy but it also giganticly marks the history of the country, especially the independence of Panama. The Panama Canal was first started to be built in 1882 by the French when Panama’s independence from Spain had already occurred and when the nation was part of La Gran Colombia. The French company was allied with Colombia to make the Panama Canal, but later the company went bankrupt. When La Gran Colombia broke down and Panama was still of the Republic of Colombia the U.S took control of the construction and hoped to agree with Colombia, but Colombia rejected it. Taking advantage of the situation, Panama, rebelled against Colombia and declared its independence in 1904 with the help of the U.S. Later, the U.S gave full control of the canal to Panama.
