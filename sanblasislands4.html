    <h3>History in Islands of Panama</h3>
        <p>
            The San Blas Islands is a beautiful and cultural archipelago in the north of Panama. The archipelago counts with 378 special and peaceful islands. The Guna (one of the most important indigenous tribes in Panama) migrated about 500 years ago from Colombia to this archipelago. The place is one of the most precious things for the Guna people. Many people may wonder why the islands are so neatly glorious. The Guna are so grateful and connected to nature that they believe that happiness is only experienced when nature makes a presence.

            When Panama became independent from Colombia at the beginning of the 20th century, Panama tried to take the land of the Guna and westernize them. Panama tried to prohibit their traditional clothes and their native language(Dulegaya). Luckily, the Guna won and didnâ€™t let their land be open for tourists. In about the 1940s the Guna let the first tourists arrive to the San Blas Islands.  Now you can visit and know about the culture of the Guna. Go and visit those sanctified islands where you will have guaranteed happiness.
